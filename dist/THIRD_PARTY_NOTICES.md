## Font Awesome Free 6.7.2 - icon fonts (`bin/x64_dx12/AMF/icons/`)

https://fontawesome.com - `fa-solid-900.ttf`, `fa-regular-400.ttf` and `fa-brands-400.ttf` from the official npm package
@fortawesome/fontawesome-free 6.7.2, unmodified. They are separate font files read at run time, not part of the program,
and ship under their own licence:

Copyright (c) 2024 Fonticons, Inc. (https://fontawesome.com) with Reserved Font Name: "Font Awesome". The font files are
licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (the icons in the package's SVG/JS forms are CC BY 4.0, its code
MIT). The full licence text ships beside the fonts as `LICENSE-FontAwesome-Free.txt`. Brand icons are trademarks of their
respective owners.

## TestBench consumer API (`include/TestBenchAPI.h`) - MIT

The small header the framework uses to register its test tools with TestBench, a separate, optional, private testing
plugin. The framework only talks to it through that interface.

## Compatibility note

The framework exports an API compatible with the PUBLIC consumer header of SKSE Menu Framework, and the full cimgui
function set, so mods written against those surfaces can register with it. It is an original implementation and
contains no code from SKSE Menu Framework.
