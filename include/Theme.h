// Theme REGISTRY (the author, 2026-08-27) - supersedes the original "no theme-customisation UI by
// design" stance recorded below, the same way a rule gets amended rather than left standing
// alongside its own contradiction (project convention: fold the update into the decision).
//
// Mirrors MO2's own theme mechanism exactly, confirmed by reading it directly
// (C:\Modlists\Apostasy\stylesheets\*.qss - one self-contained file per theme, additive,
// nothing overwrites anything else). AMF's equivalent: a Palette per theme, registered either
// at compile time (the two built-ins below) or scanned additively from
// OBSE/Plugins/ApocryphaMenuFramework/themes/*.ini at load - never mutating another
// theme's entry.
//
// Original spec this supersedes, kept for provenance:
//   "the same build philosophy as the Untarnished UI minimap edit - solid black at full
//    opacity, affected by the game's opacity setting, and the white framing around all the
//    buttons and menus." That look now SHIPS AS the "Untarnished" theme (the author's instruction),
//    one entry in the registry rather than the only possible one.
