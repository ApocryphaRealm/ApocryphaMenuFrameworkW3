// ============================================================================================
// M2: input capture - the user-validated top priority ("I can still move my perspective around
// my character instead of it halting that to use the menu", the author, first smoke test).
//
// Design per the prior-art survey (§2), adopted deliberately:
//   * ONE hook at BSInputDeviceManager::PollInputDevices (survey §2.1/§2.2) - the layer the
//     game actually reads input through, unlike WndProc games (§2.4).
//   * While the menu is open, events are SPLICED, not blunt-blocked: button RELEASES pass
//     through to the game so a key held across the open transition can never stick down (the
//     survey's central hazard - "swallow a key-down without its key-up and the game is left
//     with a key stuck down"). Everything else - presses, mouse movement, thumbsticks - is
//     consumed, which is precisely what halts the camera.
//   * Events are QUEUED in the hook and TRANSLATED on the render thread inside the present
//     hook, where the ImGui context is guaranteed (survey: "feeding io.AddKeyEvent from the
//     input thread while the render thread is inside NewFrame is a data race").
//   * Translation uses the modern 1.87+ io.Add*Event API exclusively - the pre-1.87
//     io.KeysDown[] pattern in older prior art must not be copied (survey §2.3).
