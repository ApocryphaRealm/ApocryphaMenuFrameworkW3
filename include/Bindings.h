// THE FRAMEWORK'S OWN CONTROLS, REBINDABLE (the owner, 2026-09-19: "add a tab to the controls row
// to divide controller and keyboard and let them rebind the different functions to different
// buttons/stick/mouse").
//
// Until now every control this framework claims was fixed in code: F1 opened the menu (the one
// rebindable thing), Escape closed it, Start closed it on a pad, and navigation was whatever
// ImGui's own nav keys happened to be. This gives each of them a name, a keyboard/mouse binding
// and a gamepad binding, both settable from the Controls page's two tabs.
//
// WHAT A BINDING MAY BE (the owner's "buttons/stick/mouse"):
//   keyboard side   a keyboard key (DirectInput scan code) OR a mouse button
//   gamepad side    a pad button (XInput mask) OR a stick click (L3/R3, which are just masks)
//                   OR a stick DIRECTION - left stick up, right stick left, and so on
//
// RULES THIS OBEYS, all of them standing ones:
//   * AMF's reserved keys are refused outright (rule: respect-amf-reserved-keys).
//   * Two functions that can be active at the same time may not share a binding; the capture
//     refuses and says which function already has it (rule: bindable-keys-standard-features).
//   * Every function has a keyboard row AND a gamepad row (rule:
//     rebindable-keyboard-and-gamepad-in-every-menu).
//   * The shipped defaults are the ones the framework already used, so nobody's muscle memory
//     changes by updating.
