// (Offsets.h explains the dispute), one ImGui context for the whole process.
//
// Hook installation happens in SKSEPluginLoad because renderer bring-up PRECEDES kDataLoaded -
// there is no later moment that still catches init. This is the established pattern across the
// surveyed ecosystem. It is in deliberate tension with this project's DEM crash lesson (avoid
// early relocation work); the mitigations are the byte-pattern guards - a site that does not
// look like a call instruction is never written, the framework logs why and stays inert, and
// the game boots untouched.
